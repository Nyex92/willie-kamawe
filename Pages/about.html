        <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>My name is Willie Kanyeki Kamawe. I am a graduate of <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> in Burnaby, Canada where I majored in <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2023/fall/programs/communication/major/bachelor-of-arts.html"> Communication</a> and minored in <a href="https://beedie.sfu.ca/programs/undergraduate/business-minor">Business Administration.</a> I am currently living and working in Kenya as an Operations Manager of a water company, and Founder of my own <a href="https://linktr.ee/ShujaaFitness">fitness brand</a>. I am passionate about digital media and also run my own podcasting studio called <a href="https://linktr.ee/representedstudio">Represented Studio</a> in Nairobi, Kenya where I have created widely-available podcasts.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am undertaking a web development course in an attempt to grow my skills and become more competitive professionally.</p> 
        <h3>Detailed History</h3>
            <h4>2012-2018</h4>
            <p>I began my undergraduate studies in 2012 at <a href="https://www.columbiacollege.ca/">Columbia College</a> in Vancouver, Canada. It was here that I studied a majority of my pre-requisite undergraduate courses until April 2014. I then transferred my credits to complete my undergraduate degree at Simon Fraser University in October 2016.</p>
            <p>My professional career began in early 2016, where I was hired at a startup in Vancouver, Canada as a part-time Research Assistant while still pursuing my undergraduate degee.</p>
            <p>During my time as a Research Assistant, I learned about the early stages of SaaS (Software As a Service) development. I also learned a lot about the nature of startups and building teams from scratch. Furthermore, it was my first experience working closely with software developers.</p>
            <p>Once I graduated from university in October 2016, I was hired full-time, as a Project Assistant. My experience with the same company had earned me a spot on the business team, offering extensive support in the development process.</p>
            <p>It was quite challenging supporting a multifaceted team at first. However, with more experience, I found my groove and elevated my support skills, even transitioning to a novice <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-scrum-master">Scrum Master</a> as our team adopted Agile Methodologies in the development process. My work as a Project Assistant helped me sharpen my organisational and communication skills on various levels. I am always grateful for the fruitful experience it was.</p>
        
        <h4>2018-present</h4>
            <p>In 2018, I decided to take a break from chasing a career because I felt that I did not have the chance to properly explore my life goals outside of the rigmarole of being a young, expatriate student and worker.</p>
            <p>Upon long reflection and review, I decided to repatriate to my home country Kenya in January 2019. I felt that my time abroad had come to a close.</p>
            <p>Coming back home was not as simple as one would expect. I had come to be what we called back in Vancouver, a 'Vancouverite' - I was fully immersed in my life there and had integrated to the ways of my fellow <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canuck">Canucks</a>. In an effort to acclimatize to life in Canada, my Kenyan identity was almost a thing of the past.</p>
            <p>Repatriating meant that I was on a journey of rediscovering my home country and relearning my culture once more. As odd as it sounds, I didn't realize how much I had forgotten about being Kenyan!</p>   
            <p>As I worked to realign myself with Kenyan life, I began contributing as an Operations Manager for my family's water business. This gave me the opportunity to get my hands dirty on Kenyan soil as far as figuring out the ways of doing business locally. Having to negotiate things such as licensing and parastatal relations was very enlightening.</p>
            <p>Concurrently, I built a content creation studio as a result of my growing love for the podcasting space. I had been involved in creating podcasts along with friends in Vancouer who ran an independent podcasting network called <a href="https://www.halohaloproductions.com/">Halo Halo Productions</a> (formerly known as Geek Happy Network). I created my own show called <a href="https://linktr.ee/RepresentedPodcast">'The Represented Podcast'</a>, which I then migrated over to my own space in Nairobi.</p>
            <p>In 2020, during the COVID-19 Pandemic, I founded <a href="https://linktr.ee/ShujaaFitness>">Shujaa Fitness</a>, my own brand that provides locally made fitness equipment along with informative digital content surrounding health and wellness. As an avid gym-goer since 2013, I have been passionately growing my knowlege base on health and fitness, and I saw it fit (no pun intended) to put out my own contribution into the industry. I am also a Level 2 <a href="https://www.itecworld.co.uk/qualification-category/all-categories/?LevelID=2&Keywords=Gym&QualCategoryID=13&search_type=qualifications">ITEC-certified</a> Fitness Instructor as of 2021.</p>
            <p>Along with equipment and digital content, I recently self-published an eBook called <a href="https://form.jotform.com/ShujaaFit/the-basics-to-a-better-body">'The Basics to a Better Body'</a>. A very simple guide that provides beginner information along with easy-to-follow fitness routines</p>
            <p>I firmly believe that learning never stops, and my hope is to keep growing myself and my skills. It is for this reason I am now venturing into web development as evidenced by this website. Despite my beginner status, I am excited to challenge myself to grow. Having experienced working with other web developers, I highly respect the craft and know the power that lies in the language of code.</p>
